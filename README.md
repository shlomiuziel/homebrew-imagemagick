# A Homebrew tap for ImageMagick 6.7.8-9
Based on the imagemagick@6 formula from this tap:  
[homebrew-core](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/blob/master/Formula/imagemagick@6.rb).

<br/>Install imagemagick 6.7.8-9 from this tap by running:
```bash
brew install shlomiuziel/imagemagick/imagemagick@6.7.8-9
```

Once imagemagick was built successfully, you can link it as the default compare/identify system-wide command by invoking:

```bash
brew link --force imagemagick@6.7.8-9
```

#### (This step is required because it's a keg-only formula.)
